Pointers

* (reference operator)
	- when used on variable initialization: 
		creates a pointer that points to the address of the variable assigned
		### 
			int target = 5;
			int* intptr = &target;					// intptr points to the address target is stored inside
		###
	- when used on a pointer:
		retrieves the value from the address a pointer is pointing to
		###
			cout << *intptr << "\n";				// prints out "5"
		###

& (dereference pointer)
	- when used on a pointer:
		retrieves the address of the pointer
	- when used on a variable:
		retrieves the address of the variable

Array
	- Creating an array equals to creating a pointer that points to the first element in an array
		###
			int arr[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};
			// 'arr' is a pointer that points to the address of "1"
		###

LESSON 6: Multiple MVCs, Segues

Segues
	- Things done inside prepareForSegue are done before IBOutlets are created. 
	  So, pass models for the IBOutlets to use to draw UI

View Controller Lifecycle (In order)
	Instantiation

	awakeFromNib
		- sent to all objects that come out of a storyboard
		- happens before outlets are set

	Segue preparation

	Outlets setup

	viewDidLoad()
		- loaded only once
		- set UI here
		- BUT geometry of your view is not set, so do not initialize things 
		that are geometry dependent here

	viewWillAppear()
		- do something here if things your display is changing while your MVC is off screen
		- could use this to optimize performance by waiting until this method is called
		to kick off an expensive operation
		- geometry is set here, but use some other place
	viewDidAppear()
		- good place to do animation

	viewWillDisappear()
		- do some clean up, now that we've been removed from the screen
		- don't do something time-consuming here, maybe use a thread
	viewDidDisappear()

	viewWillLayoutSubviews()
	viewDidLayoutSubviews()
		- good place to do geometry dependent stuff
		- autolayout happens somewhere between these two methods
		- anytime after viewDidLoad()
		* might be called more often that you imagine (not just initialization)

	viewWillTransitionToSize()
		- if you want to participate in the rotation animation

	didReceiveMemoryWarning
		- called when memory is low

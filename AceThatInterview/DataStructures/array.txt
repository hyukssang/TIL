ARRAY

	Characteristics
		- Wastes memory if size is too large
		- Requires reallocation if too small

	Operation Time Complexity
		Random Access:	O(1)
		Sequential Access: O(1)
		Search:	O(n)
		Insertion: O(n)
		Append: O(n)
		Deletion: O(n)

	Declaration (C++)
		m1. char s1[15] = "Hello ";	
		m2. char s2[] = "World";
		m3. char *x = "Hello ";

		- Allocates space for specified number + 1, where last one is for null character
		- Allocates memory on the stack (unless declared with dynamic memory allocation using new)
		- Avoid fixed-length buffers for variable-length input
		-> Source of 70% of security breaches

	1D Array <-> 2D Array
		1D -> 2D
			- column = index % num_cols
			- row = index / num_cols
		2D -> 1D
			- index = row * num_cols + col

MERGESORT

	Characteristics
		- Combining two ordered files to make one larger ordered file

	Order of Execution
		Top-Down
			1. Recursively divide an array into two arrays
			2. When you are at the point where arrays are of length <= 1, start merging two arrays with their items sorted in a combined array, return the new array
		Bottom-Up
			1. Directly start at the bottom, proceed upwards by iterating over the pieces and merging them.
			(Basically Top-Down w/o the recursively going down the tree part)

	Performance
		Time
			- Best, Average, Worst: O(nlogn)
		Memory
			- O(n) additional memory (from creating new arrays to be copied from existing at each step)
